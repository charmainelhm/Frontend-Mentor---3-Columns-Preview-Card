## Acknowledgments

Practice is a very important learning stage in coding, and I want to thank Frontend Mentor(https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for making it easier for me to do that. With their help, I can focus on understanding the different properties in HTML and CSS with my minimal knowledge on UI and UX design.
